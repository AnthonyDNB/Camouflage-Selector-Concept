# Preview Camouflage Selector Concept For DK2

My preview concept of how KHG may going about to add an Camouflage/Outfit selector to DoorKickers 2 when the v1.0 update comes out, the mod is not the best and they is a lot of things can be imporve on it i cant do but it works 

Because of many technical issues and deal breakers I encountered I decided to post the mod on here instead of nexus, but due of many ground breaking issues I fixed I may entertain the idea to post it on nexus

And before you download this can you please read the Known Issues sub-heading

For any Questions/Suggestions please DM me on Discord AnthonyNonStop#9094 or @Anthony in the #dk2_mod_discussion channel in the DoorKickers Discord

-Debug Box <br />
  Basically its an debugging tool to test out the outfits/camos of this concept preview mod, normally it will be disabled

# How it works
The mod works by replacing the default human models with sly's clothing cube model and the human 3D model gets added on by using an "ExplosiveCharge" entity, i know its not the best but if it ain't broke, don't fix it

# Known Issues

-Due to how concealment works it disableds any equipment from showing up if the cocealment level is covert and beacuse of this undercover operators can only have thier defult outfit and blackops operators cant equip the poncho

-The default camos wont be equiped by default so you will need to apply it yourself before you start the game or the 3d models wont show

-Not a issue but one thing annoyed me is I couldn't get the ui of how i wanted it to be
