# Preview Camouflage Selector Concept For DK2

My preview concept of how KHG may add an Camouflage/Outfit selector to DoorKickers 2 in a future game update, But however, because of some technical issues and deal breakers I encountered. I couldn't make this an proper mod I would like to publish on nexus/ the official steam workshop so that's why I am posting it on here instead

Due to how this mod works, this mod wont be compatible to any other mods that replaces the default human models in the game like the T1 mod and any clothing mods

For any Questions/Suggestions please DM me on Discord AnthonyNonStop#9094 or @Anthony in the #dk2_mod_discussion channel in the DoorKickers Discord

# Features

-MultiCam (Default) Camo <br />
-Flannel Outfit <br />
-DPM Desert Camo<br />

-Debug Box <br />
  It doesn't equip any Human 3D model at all so you can use it to help you to make and debug outfits/3d models if needs be

-WIP Flannel Outfit CIA<br />
  I am using this to try to get lockpicking back to the CIA due to a technical issue

# How it works
The mod works by replacing the default human models with sly's clothing cube model and the human 3D model gets added on by using an "ExplosiveCharge" entity 

# Technical Issues and Deal Breakers

-The big deal breaker for me is the lockpic wont work anymore becuse i used a INV slot reserved for the lockpic (its the only way i could do it) but however i think i got a idea how to fix this in a later game update

-The 2nd thing that bugged me is I couldn't get the ui of how i wanted it to be in a different sub-menu with added details

-Also one big note the MultiCam (Default) camo wont be equiped by default so you will need to apply it yourself before you start the game or the 3d models wont show
