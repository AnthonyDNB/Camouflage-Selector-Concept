# Camouflage Selector Concept For DK2

My concept of how KHG could add an Camouflage/Outfit selector to DoorKickers 2, but however due to some technical issues and deal breakers I have faced, I couldn't make this an proper mod I would like to publish on nexus/ the official steam workshop so that's why I am posting it on here

Due to how this mod works, this mod wont be compatible to any other mods that replaces the default human models in the game like the T1 mod and any clothing mods

For any Questions/Suggestions please DM me on Discord AnthonyNonStop#9094 or @Anthony in the #dk2_mod_discussion channel in the DoorKickers Discord

# Features

-MultiCam (Default) Camo <br />
-Flannel Outfit <br />
-DPM Desert Camo<br />

-Debug Box <br />
  It doesn't equip any Human 3D model at all so you can use it to help you to make outfits/3d models if needs be

-WIP Flannel Outfit CIA<br />
  I am using this to try to get lockpicking back to the CIA due to a technical issue

# How it works
The mod works by replacing the default human models with sly's clothing cube model and the human 3D model gets added on by the Camos/Outfits GUI selector by using an "ExplosiveCharge" entity
