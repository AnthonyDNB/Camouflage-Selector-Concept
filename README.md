# Preview Camouflage Selector Concept For DK2 e

My preview concept of how KHG are going to add an Camouflage/Outfit selector to DoorKickers 2 when the v1.0 update comes out, But however, because of some technical issues and deal breakers I encountered. I couldn't make this an proper mod I would like to publish on nexus/ the official steam workshop so that's why I am posting it on Github and using the term "**Concept**" 

Btw due to many issues with the CIA this is now a rangers only mod and also due to how this mod works it wont be compatible to any other mods that uses the default human models

For any Questions/Suggestions please DM me on Discord AnthonyNonStop#9094 or @Anthony in the #dk2_mod_discussion channel in the DoorKickers Discord

# Features

-MultiCam (Default) Camo <br />
-Flannel Outfit <br />
-DPM Desert Camo<br />
-MTP Camo<br />

-Debug Box <br />
  It doesn't equip any Human 3D model at all so you can use it to help you to make and debug outfits/3d models if needs be

# How it works
The mod works by replacing the default human models with sly's clothing cube model and the human 3D model gets added on by using an "ExplosiveCharge" entity 

# Technical Issues and Deal Breakers

-The big deal breaker for me is the lockpic wont work anymore becuse i used a INV slot normally reserved for the lockpic (its the only way i could do it)

-The 2nd thing that bugged me is I couldn't get the ui of how i wanted it to be in a different sub-menu with added details

-Also one big note the MultiCam (Default) camo wont be equiped by default so you will need to apply it yourself before you start the game or the 3d models wont show
