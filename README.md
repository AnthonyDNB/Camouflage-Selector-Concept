# Camouflage Selector Concept For DK2

My concept of how KHG could add an Camouflage/Outfit selector to DoorKickers 2, but however due to some technical issues and deal breakers I have faced, I couldn't make this an proper mod I would like to publish on nexus/ the offical steam workshop so thats why I am posting it on here

Due to how this mod works, this mod wont be compatible to any other mods that replaces the default human models in the game

For any questons/suggestions please DM me on Discord AnthonyNonStop#9094 or @Anthony in the #dk2_mod_discussion channel in the DoorKickers Discord
