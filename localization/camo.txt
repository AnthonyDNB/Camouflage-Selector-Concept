# IMPORTANT
# -Do not modify/localize %s, %d, %u or any other such constructs, leave them as they are.
# -Do not modify \n (it moves the text following it to the next line).
# -Text IDs ending in _ttip or _tooltip can be translated using any length, for all others try to keep the same length (though it depends from text to text).
# -Keep every @id=text on one line
